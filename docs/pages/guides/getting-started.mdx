# Getting Started

## Creating your Wear OS app [#wear-os-setup]

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend having a `/wear` directory alongside your `/src` or `/app`
  directory, this will make it easier to build and develop your app.
</Callout>

Start by adding a Wear OS app to your project, you can use Android Studio's Wear OS template, we recommend using the template with a tile, but if you think you do not require a tile then pick just the app.

## Ready your React Native app

<Steps>
### Package Name
Make sure your React Native app and your Wear OS app both share the same package name.
 
### Signing Key
Make sure your React Native app and your Wear OS app both use the same signing key when publishing your app.

- If you're developing, you can leave both unsigned
- If you're using expo you can use `eas credentials`

</Steps>

## Sending data to your Wear OS app [#sending-data]

Start sending data to your Wear OS app by using `sendMessage`:

```tsx
import { sendMessage } from 'react-native-wear';

await sendMessage({
  message: 'Hello there :)',
  // ...
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  `sendMessage` accepts an object with any key/values
</Callout>
