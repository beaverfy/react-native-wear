# Getting Started

## Creating your Wear OS app [#wear-os-setup]

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend having a `/wear` directory alongside your `/src` or `/app`
  directory, this will make it easier to build and develop your app.
</Callout>

Start by adding a Wear OS app to your project, you can use Android Studio's Wear OS template or use the react native example.

<Callout type="error">
  Using React Native on Wear OS isn't recommended since there's no native
  component libraries available
</Callout>

## Ready your React Native app

<Steps>
### Package Name
Make sure your React Native app and your Wear OS app both share the same package name.
 
### Signing Key
Make sure your React Native app and your Wear OS app both use the same signing key when publishing your app.

- If you're developing, you can leave both unsigned
- If you're using expo you can use `eas credentials`

</Steps>

## Sending data to your Wear OS app [#sending-data]

Start sending data to your Wear OS app by using `sendMessage` or `sendMessageAsync`:

<Tabs items={['Promises', 'Callbacks']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```tsx
import { sendMessageAsync } from 'react-native-wear';

await sendMessageAsync({
  message: 'Hello there :)',
  // ...
})
  .then((reply) => console.log('Message sent', reply))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Failed to send message', error));
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```tsx
import { sendMessage } from 'react-native-wear';

await sendMessage(
  {
    message: 'Hello there :)',
    // ...
  },
  (reply) => console.log('Message sent', reply),
  (error) => console.log('Failed to send message', error)
);
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  `sendMessage` accepts an object with any key/values
</Callout>
