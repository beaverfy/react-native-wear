# Receiving Data

You may want to receive data from your Wear OS client, to receive data, set up a listener using `watchEvents`:

```tsx
import { watchEvents } from 'react-native-wear';

const unsubscribe = watchEvents.on('message', (message) => {
  // message is an object of the data
  // received from the watch
});
```
